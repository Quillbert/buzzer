# Buzzer
When COVID-19 hit, the Quiz Bowl league to which my school belongs went virtual. However, the league was unable to find an online buzzer that was both free and accommodated the full set of rules. I was able to use my networking skills to make this buzzer, which meets both of those requirements. It can be found at https://marist-buzzer.herokuapp.com/.
